\title{ie2misc: Irucka Embry's miscellaneous USGS functions}
\description{
ie2misc provides many functions that will be useful to people within the
 USGS, while other functions will be useful for others. Functions are
 included for statistical errors (RMSE, NSE, dr, MAPE, MAE, MAD),
 processing .exp and .psf files, a "+" dyadic operator for use with NA,
 and making it easier to view USGS ADAPS and QW files within a spreadsheet
 application.
